    "I plan to research abortion rates of various age groups across the United States and the access to/use contraceptives in these states. This is a highly relevant topic as our country deals with information regarding Roe vs. Wade. I am particularly interested in learning about how access to contraceptives impacted abortion rates and if the increase in access to contraceptives has impacted individual state rates of abortion. I also want to learn more in general about abortion because I want to have concrete data to explain why we should have abortion rights. I hope to research data that can support my arguments and share the information with others who may not be educated on the topic of abortion. \n",

    "## Background and/or Related Work\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of research and background information about abortion due to the current situation with Roe vs. Wade. There is data regarding contraceptive rates and specific state-by-state pregnancy and abortion rates. All of the background information emphasizes the need for awareness of the issue of abortion and the impact state laws, access to safe abortion, access to effective birth control, and freedom over women’s bodies have on people in different areas of the United States. I designed this study to compare the connection between abortion rates and access to contraceptives and compare different areas of the United States. The information below shows that views and access to abortion and contraceptives vary drastically nationwide. \n",
    "\n",
    "One background information is that accessible birth control has decreased abortion rates. Although there has been an increase in abortion restrictions across the U.S., this was not the main driver for the decrease in abortion; instead, access to contraceptives seems to have lowered abortion and pregnancy rates.Click [here](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-parenthood-record-low-abortion-rates-in-u-s-highlight-impact-of-access-to-birth-control) to read more. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specific data about access to contraceptives has also been researched and published on [Power to Decide](https://powertodecide.org/what-we-do/access/birth-control-access). A diagram shows the distribution of birth control and emphasizes that “19 million women live in contraception deserts”.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also current information about the specific abortion laws in individual states, found through [Guttmacher](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/overview-abortion-laws).\n",
    "One of the more compelling highlights of information regarding specific state abortion laws was that “45 states allow individual health care providers to refuse to participate in an abortion. Forty-two states allow institutions to refuse to perform abortions, 16 of which limit refusal to private or religious institutions”. It is most concerning to read about states such as Alabama, where abortion is completely banned. This is drastically different from states such as California, where it is fully legal and even requires universities to give students abortion pills for free. More about the specifics for each state are written [here](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/abortion-laws-by-state)."

    "## Findings: \n",
    "\n",
    "* RQ1: The number of pregnancies averted from using contraceptives is higher in comparison to the number of abortions when observed overall across the United States for the majority of states. The values for the state with most pregnancies prevented is also signficantly higher ranging in the 300,000s versus the abortions which the highest range in the 100,000s.\n",
    "\n",
    "* RQ2: The pacific northwest and the northeast had the highest rates of abortion across the various regions of the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion/Implications: \n",
    "\n",
    "Research Q1 Discussion: The chart comparing abortion numbers and pregnancies averted demonstrates that contraceptives do help prevent unwanted pregnancies, which would, in turn, lead to more abortions if not averted. Contraceptive use correlates with successfully preventing abortions across the United States, with higher levels of prevented pregnancies in California and, more surprisingly, in Texas. I infer that contraceptive use for preventing pregnancies is higher in Texas than abortion numbers because abortion rates are not more likely not reported. However, the overall population is still quite large, creating a more significant number of using contraceptives. It was also interesting to see that contraceptive use for pregnancy prevention was not higher than abortion rates in New York, where it would be believed that more people have access to or are using contraceptives. A limitation in regards to these findings was that some states may have higher rates for who is reporting abortions rather than use contraceptives based on sensitives regarding the topic of abortion and the laws surrounding it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Research Q2 Discussion: I initially hypothesized that \"Rates of abortions are higher in states where abortion is more accepted (specifically the West Coast and Northeast region) because people are more comfortable and feel safer sharing the data.\" These regions did turn out to have the highest rates of abortion, and I can infer that this is because people are most comfortable reporting abortions and have higher access levels to abortion based on state laws read during background research. A more concrete reason is that these two regions have been placed with more liberal abortion laws and larger populations. Abortion is legal in all of the pacific region states and is legal at any stage in some of those states. California also has one of the largest populations, and the rate is still high, showing that many people have gotten an abortion compared to other places. New York is another place with a very large population in the northeast, meaning more people in a condensed area are getting abortions. The states in this region all allow for legal abortions, with the majority only allowing abortions up until 24 weeks, but some allowing abortions during the entire term of pregnancy. Again a limitation with this data could relate to the sensitivity of discussing or sharing abortion and how it is more accepeted in specific states and regions and therefore more documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion: \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, contraceptive use correlates with successfully preventing abortions across the United States, with higher levels of prevented pregnancies in comparison to abortions for a majority of states. It is also interesting to see how more populated areas have better access to contraceptives. It is essential to continue researching and discussing abortion and contraceptives to give people in all areas of the country easy access to both medical options to decrease the number of abortions that must happen and women's safety. \n",
    "\n",
    "Concerning abortion rates specifically and my second research question, the rates across regions of the United States are highest in areas with large populations and legalized abortion. The laws and attitudes of individual states or regions of the United States impacts the abortion rates that are reported and that are allowed to openly occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this report were to be continued, I would compare the specific regions and attempt to map out the data on a state map.\n"
